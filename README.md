# Seed & Grain App

## Description

The Seeds and Grains App is a project developed as a didactic demonstration in a didactic aptitude test for a public contest I am applying for here in Brazil for a position as a university professor.
In this sense of functioning as a didactic tool, the application aims to provide a convenient platform to access information and exercises related to the subjects that I may teach if I am approved as a Professor.
I hope to obtain a good position in this contest.
